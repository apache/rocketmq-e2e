Feature: Test message property

  Scenario: Message user property beyond limit 128 ,expect throw exception
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), Body("random-body"), and userProperty("random-userProperty")
    And Set message "userProperty" "129" times
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then Check exceptions can be thrown
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

  Scenario: The number of message user properties equals limit 128, expect send and consume success
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist, a "Concurrently" group:"random-group"
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a PushConsumer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), ConsumerGroup("random-group"), Tag("TagA"), Topic("random-topic"), MessageListener("default")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), Body("random-body"), and userProperty("random-userProperty")
    And Set message "userProperty" "128" times
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then  Check all messages that can be consumed within 60s
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

  Scenario: Message user property equals 16KB, expect send and consume success
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist, a "Concurrently" group:"random-group"
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a PushConsumer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), ConsumerGroup("random-group"), Tag("TagA"), Topic("random-topic"), MessageListener("default")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), Body("random-body"), and userProperty("size:16kB")
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then  Check all messages that can be consumed within 60s
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started


  Scenario: Message user property beyond 16KB, expect throw exception
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), Body("random-body"), and userProperty("size:16kB+1")
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then Check exceptions can be thrown
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

  Scenario Outline: Message user property contains invisible character \u0000 / use SystemKey UNIQ_KEY ,expect throw exception
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), and userProperty("<KeyContent>", "<ValueContent>")
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then Check exceptions can be thrown
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

    Examples:
      | KeyContent | ValueContent |
      | \u0000     | value        |
      | UNIQ_KEY   | value        |

  Scenario: Message user property ,key and tag beyond 16KB ,expect throw exception
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), Tag("size:4kB"), Key("size:4kB"), Value("size:4kB"), Body("size:4M"), msgKey("size:4kB+1")
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then Check exceptions can be thrown
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

  Scenario: Message user property ,key and tag equals 16KB, expect send and consume success
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist, a "Concurrently" group:"random-group"
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a PushConsumer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), ConsumerGroup("random-group"), Tag("TagA"), Topic("random-topic"), MessageListener("default")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), Tag("size:4kB"), Key("size:4kB"), Value("size:4kB"), Body("size:4M"), msgKey("size:4kB")
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then  Check all messages that can be consumed within 60s
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

  Scenario: Message user property ,key and tag equals 64B, expect send and consume success
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist, a "Concurrently" group:"random-group"
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), Tag("size:64B"), Key("size:64B"), Value("size:64B"), Body("size:64B"), msgKey("size:64B")
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then  Check all messages that can be consumed within 60s
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

  Scenario: Message user property is the visible character, expect send and consume success
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist, a "Concurrently" group:"random-group"
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a PushConsumer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), ConsumerGroup("random-group"), Tag("TagA"), Topic("random-topic"), MessageListener("default")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), Tag("random-tag"), Key("中文"), Value("中文"), Body("random-body"), msgKey("random-msgkey")
    And Set Key("_"), Value("_")
    And Set Key("%"), Value("%")
    And Set Key("。"), Value("。")
    And Set Key("|"), Value("|")
    And Set Key("&&"), Value("&&")
    And Set Key("🏷"), Value("🏷")
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then  Check all messages that can be consumed within 60s
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started
