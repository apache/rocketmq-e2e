Feature: Test message property

  Scenario: Message property beyond limit 128 ,expect throw exception
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), Body("random-body"), and messageProperty("random-messageProperty")
    And Set message "messageProperty" "129" times
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then Check exceptions can be thrown
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

  Scenario: The number of message properties equals limit 128, expect send and consume success
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist, a "Concurrently" group:"random-group"
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a PushConsumer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), ConsumerGroup("random-group"), Tag("TagA"), Topic("random-topic"), MessageListener("default")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), Body("random-body"), and messageProperty("random-messageProperty")
    And Set message "messageProperty" "128" times
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then  Check all messages that can be consumed within 60s
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

  Scenario: Message property equals 16KB, expect send and consume success
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist, a "Concurrently" group:"random-group"
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a PushConsumer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), ConsumerGroup("random-group"), Tag("TagA"), Topic("random-topic"), MessageListener("default")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), Body("random-body"), and messageProperty("size:16kB")
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then  Check all messages that can be consumed within 60s
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started


  Scenario: Message property beyond 16KB, expect throw exception
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), Body("random-body"), and messageProperty("size:16kB+1")
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then Check exceptions can be thrown
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

  Scenario Outline: Message property contains invisible character \u0000 / use SystemKey UNIQ_KEY ,expect throw exception
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), and messageProperty("<KeyContent>", "<ValueContent>")
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then Check exceptions can be thrown
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

    Examples:
      | KeyContent | ValueContent |
      | \u0000     | value        |
      | UNIQ_KEY   | value        |

  Scenario: Message property ,key and tag beyond 16KB ,expect throw exception
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), Tag("size:4kB"), Key("size:4kB"), Value("size:4kB"), Body("size:4M"), msgKey("size:4kB+1")
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then Check exceptions can be thrown
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

  Scenario: Message property ,key and tag equals 16KB, expect send and consume success
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist, a "Concurrently" group:"random-group"
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a PushConsumer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), ConsumerGroup("random-group"), Tag("TagA"), Topic("random-topic"), MessageListener("default")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), Tag("size:4kB"), Key("size:4kB"), Value("size:4kB"), Body("size:4M"), msgKey("size:4kB")
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then  Check all messages that can be consumed within 60s
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

  Scenario: Message property ,key and tag equals 64B, expect send and consume success
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist, a "Concurrently" group:"random-group"
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), Tag("size:64B"), Key("size:64B"), Value("size:64B"), Body("size:64B"), msgKey("size:64B")
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then  Check all messages that can be consumed within 60s
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

  Scenario: Message property is the visible character, expect send and consume success
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist, a "Concurrently" group:"random-group"
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a PushConsumer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), ConsumerGroup("random-group"), Tag("TagA"), Topic("random-topic"), MessageListener("default")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), Tag("random-tag"), Key("‰∏≠Êñá"), Value("‰∏≠Êñá"), Body("random-body"), msgKey("random-msgkey")
    And Set messageProperty "Key" to "_" and "Value" to "_"
    And Set messageProperty "Key" to "%" and "Value" to "%"
    And Set messageProperty "Key" to "„ÄÇ" and "Value" to "„ÄÇ"
    And Set messageProperty "Key" to "ÔΩú" and "Value" to "ÔΩú"
    And Set messageProperty "Key" to "&&" and "Value" to "&&"
    And Set messageProperty "Key" to "üè∑" and "Value" to "üè∑"
    And  Send "a" messages "synchronous"
    Then  Check all messages that can be consumed within 60s
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started
