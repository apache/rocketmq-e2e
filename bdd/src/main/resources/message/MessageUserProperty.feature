Feature: Test user property

  Scenario: Message user property beyond limit 128 ,expect throw exception
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("Normal random-topic"), and userProperty("size:129")
    And  Send "1" messages "synchronous"
    Then Check exceptions can be thrown
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

  Scenario: The number of message user properties equals limit 128, expect send success
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("Normal random-topic"), and userProperty("size:128")
    And  Send "1" messages "synchronous"
    Then Check there no fail message occurs
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

  Scenario Outline: Setting illegal Message user property, expect send success
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("Normal random-topic"), Body("random-body"), Key("<KeyContent>"), and Value("<ValueContent>")
    And  Send "1" messages "synchronous"
    Then Check there no fail message occurs
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started
    Examples:
      | KeyContent | ValueContent |
      | size:8kB   | size:8kB     |
      |   ‰∏≠Êñá      |   ‰∏≠Êñá        |
      |    _       |    _         |
      |    %       |    %         |
      |    „ÄÇ      |    „ÄÇ         |
      |    ÔΩú      |    ÔΩú         |
      |    &&      |    &&        |
      |    üè∑      |    üè∑        |


  Scenario Outline: Setting illegal user properties, expect throw exception

    And Create a message, including the Topic("Normal random-topic"), Body("random-body"), Key("<KeyContent>"), and Value("<ValueContent>")
    And  Send "1" messages "synchronous"
    Then Check there no fail message occurs
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

    Examples:
      | KeyContent | ValueContent |
      | size:8kB   | size:8kB+1   |
      | \u0000     | value        |
      | UNIQ_KEY   | value        |

  Scenario: Message user property ,key and tag beyond 16KB ,expect throw exception
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("Normal random-topic"), Tag("size:4kB"), Key("size:4kB"), Value("size:4kB"), Body("size:4M"), msgKey("size:4kB+1")
    And  Send "1" messages "synchronous"
    Then Check exceptions can be thrown
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

  Scenario: Message user property ,key and tag equals 16KB, expect send success
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")

    And  Send "1" messages "synchronous"
    Then Check there no fail message occurs
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

  Scenario: Message user property ,key and tag equals 64B, expect send success
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist
    When Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    And Create a message, including the Topic("Normal random-topic"), Tag("size:64B"), Key("size:64B"), Value("size:64B"), Body("size:64B"), msgKey("size:64B")
    And  Send "1" messages "synchronous"
    Then Check there no fail message occurs
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started
