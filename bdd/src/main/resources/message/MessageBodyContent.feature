Feature: Test message body contents

  Scenario Outline: Send normal message, setting message body, expect consume success
    Given Create a "Normal" topic:"random-topic" if not exist, a "Concurrently" group:"random-group"
    When Create a PushConsumer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), ConsumerGroup("random-group"), Tag("TagA"), Topic("random-topic"), MessageListener("default")
    And Create a Producer, set the Endpoint("127.0.0.1:9876"), RequestTimeout:("10s"), Topic("random-topic")
    Then Create a message, including the Topic("random-topic"), Tag("TagA"), Key("Key"), and Body("<MessageBodyContent>")
    And  Send "1" messages "synchronous"
    Then  Check all messages that can be consumed within 60s
    And Check the subscribed message body is equal to "<MessageBodyContent>"
    And Shutdown the producer and consumer if they are started

    Examples:
      | MessageBodyContent |
      |                    |
      |       中文字符       |
      |         😱         |
